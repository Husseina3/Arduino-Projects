# Project-Implemented using Arduino
This folder consistes of different embbedded system designs and Internet of things (IOT) implementations using an arduino platform. The projects use different sensors, LED's, motors, Infrared recievers, WIFI Modules, Bluetooth low energy modules and so much more. These projects have different applications such as smart home applications and office applications. 
Arduino has numourous built in functions that implement different functions that can be used easily. The projects listed below use arduino's built in functions for efficient implementations.
