# Project-Implemented 
This folder consistes of different embbedded system designs and Internet of things (IOT) implementations using an arduino platform. The projects use different sensors, LED's, motors, Infrared recievers, WIFI Modules, Bluetooth low energy modules and so much more. These projects have different applications such as smart home applications and office applications. 
Arduino has numourous built in functions that implement different functions that can be used easily. The projects listed below use arduino's built in functions for efficient implementations. 
## List of Projects
1. Remote Controlled Lights: 
This Project implements a multi purpose remote controlled switch where a device that is intended to be controlled would be plugged into an outlet which in return will be powered on or off using a remote control.
2. Object Distance detection and Display:
This project uses an ultra sonic sensor to measure the relative distance of objects from the sensor and Displays it on an LCD screen.
